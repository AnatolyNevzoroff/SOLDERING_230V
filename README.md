# SOLDERING_230V
Do-it-yourself soldering iron assembly, under the control of Arduino, on 900M tips (230V)
The soldering iron assembly with a 24-volt power supply ended successfully.
I decided to reduce the design, but leave all the functionality.
To do this, I abandoned the power supply and applied a 230 volt ceramic heater.
To control the load, a scheme with controlled arduo simistor was used.
The inclusion of a thyristor occurs only at the time of the transition of sinusoids through 0 and completely hesch
The appearance of interference arising from the usual dimmer control scheme. Power adjustment occurs
Due to the change in the number of semi-dimensions supplied to the load.
To control lighting devices, this method is not suitable, but for a ceramic heater
Great.

All third-party libraries I found and connected to Arduino IDE. There are two libraries on GitHub, if you cannot find it yourself, you can pick it up from the OUTSIDE_LIBRARIES folder.
